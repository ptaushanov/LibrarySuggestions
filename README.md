# 📖 Library suggestion 📖

This C# solution contains two projects, a WPF project and a Winforms one. Both
of them share the same logic for creating suggestions based on what was typed in
the textbox. The challenge is to create the logic modular and reusable, so that
it can be used in both projects.

**Note:** This solutions was used for the subject "Programming Systems" at the
Technical University of Sofia.
